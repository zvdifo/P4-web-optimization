## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

My challenge is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).
